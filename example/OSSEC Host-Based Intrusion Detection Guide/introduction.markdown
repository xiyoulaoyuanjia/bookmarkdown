**Who Should Read This Book?**

This book was written for network, systems, and security administrators who are responsible
for protecting assets in their infrastructure. This book is also for those involved in the incident
handling process and forensic analysis of servers and workstations. Documentation on how to
install and configure OSSEC has been freely available on the OSSEC website for some time,
but a definitive guide has never been released. This has left very important and powerful features
of the product undocumented ... until now! Using this book you will be able to install and
configure OSSEC, on the operating system of your choosing, and provide detailed examples
to help you prevent and mitigate attacks on your systems.
