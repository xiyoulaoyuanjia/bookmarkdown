A rootkit is a program developed to gain covert control over an operating system while hiding
from and interacting with the system on which it is installed. 

_rootkit 是一种被设计用来隐藏在操作系统伺机控制系统或者与安装的系统交互的程序_

An installed rootkit can hide services, processes, ports, ﬁles, directories, and registry keys from the rest of the operating system and from the user.
