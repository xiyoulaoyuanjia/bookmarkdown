Downloading OSSEC HIDS
=========

The OSSEC HIDS is most commonly downloaded, compiled, and installed from its source
code form. Precompiled packages are not currently available from www.ossec.net, with the
exception of the Windows agent. However, the compiling, configuring, and installation of
the OSSEC HIDS software is all handled with a single and simple to use script.

On Linux- or BSD-based systems, the installation begins the same way regardless of
which install type you select. For Windows, an executable installer is provided and performs
the agent install type.
