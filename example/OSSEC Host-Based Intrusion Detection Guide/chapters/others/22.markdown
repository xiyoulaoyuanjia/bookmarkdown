Building and Installing
===========

Whether you are doing a local or server installation, the first stage is the same. Extract the .
tar.gz file, change into the created directory, and then run the install script.


# gunzip -c ossec-hids-1.3.tar.gz | tar -xf -
# cd ossec-hids-1.3
# ./install.sh


The installation script is divided into several steps to guide you through the installation.
The steps are slightly different for each install type. However, the initial screen is the same
for all installations and allows you to choose your preferred language. Here we choose the
default en for English by pressing Enter.

Next, we press Enter to move to the selection of install type. At this point, you must
decide which install type you require. You might now decide to jump ahead in the chapter
to a specific install, but be sure to review all installation types because each type provides
useful information about OSSEC HIDS components and features.
