Performing Server-Agent Installations
==================

Performing Server-Agent Installations


Server-agent installations are meant for a central controller with multiple agents, which is ideal
for providing protection among networked hosts. It provides some advantages over simply having
local installations on each host. This is because the server performs all log analysis for agents
connected to it. Active responses are initiated from the server, but can be executed on an
agent or all agents simultaneously.

Because Windows hosts can only be agents, a server is always required prior to installing
the OSSEC HIDS on Microsoft Windows. Windows installations are covered separately in
this chapter, after a Unix server-agent setup.


The server and agent installations proceed similar to the local installation, except that the
server is configured to listen for communication from the agents.
